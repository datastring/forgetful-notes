Arpeggios on keyboard instruments may be called rolled chords.
Arpeggios indicate a chord in which the notes are sounded individually. The word &amp;ldquo;arpeggio&amp;rdquo; comes from the Italian word &amp;ldquo;arpeggiare,&amp;rdquo; which means to play on a harp.

They are meant to be read and understood without needing to refer to anything more. They can be connected to another atomic note or idea in some way. By breaking down complex ideas into smaller, atomic notes, one can make their notes more organized and easier to review later.

A chord, in music, is any harmonic set of pitches/frequencies consisting of multiple notes (also called &amp;ldquo;pitches&amp;rdquo;) that are heard as if sounding simultaneously. For many practical and theoretical purposes, arpeggios and other types of broken chords (in which the chord tones are not sounded simultaneously) may also be considered as chords in the right musical context.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Care</title><link>https://forgetful.dev/notes/Continuous-Care/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://forgetful.dev/notes/Continuous-Care/</guid><description>Be the watchful caretaker of your ever growing plants and flowers.

A poem is a singular piece of poetry.
Show, don’t tell. The goal is to provoke an emotion in the reader. Less can be more. While it’s perfectly acceptable to write long, flowery verse, using simple, concise language is also powerful.
