{"/":{"title":"Welcome to my Digital Garden","content":"\n## What is a Digital Garden?\n\nA digital garden is a combination of an **online notebook** and a **personal Wiki**, where digital gardeners write in small, unfinished pieces, also known as [[notes/atomic notes|atomic notes]], and share these _seeds of thought_ to be cultivated in public. Digital gardens are curated and evolve over time, sometimes growing wildly and sometimes getting pruned.\n\nThe phrase \"digital garden\" comes up _often_ while browsing these notes. Surely I overuse it. That said, I still like it. It more closely describes what I envision this website to be: a carefully curated garden of digital notes. Having a reliable system on which to dump raw information is extremely useful. The idea of [[content/notes/Sweep Your Mind|sweeping]] one's mind is helpful to rid yourself of distractions from incorrectly prioritized tasks.\n\nNetworked thinking can happen at many levels. A digital garden is a scalable way to transform seeds of information into original work and to go from collector to creator. A place where little changes accumulate and transform thoughts and ideas. [[notes/continuous care|Continuous care]] in creating and maintaining a digital garden eventually yields fruits. (pun intended)\n\nGardens are _explorable_ rather than structured as a strictly linear stream of posts. They grow _slowly_ over time, rather than creating _\"finished\"_ work that you never touch again. You revise, update, and change your ideas as they develop.\n\nHere's a few links to help you navigate the garden.\n\n{{\u003c columns \u003e}}\n\n## Pages\n\n- [[journals/_index|Journals]]\n- [[Tasks]]\n- [[Today I Learned]]\n- [[references/grammar|Grammar]]\n- [[notes/MPV Player|MPV Player]]\n- [[references/Python|Python]]\n- [[notes/Sans-serif|Sans-serif]]\n- [[notes/Serif|Serif]]\n- [[references/Skullcandy Crusher ANC|Skullcandy Crusher ANC]]\n- [[changelog|Changelog]]\n\n\u003c---\u003e\n## Lists\n\n- [[lists/bookmarklets|Bookmarklets]]\n- [[cool things|Cool Things]]\n- [[lists/Inspiration|Inspiration]]\n- [[lists/link collection|Link Collection]]\n- [[lists/newsletters collection|Newsletters Collection]]\n- [[lists/podcast collection|Podcast Collection]]\n- [[lists/quotes collection|Quotes Collection]]\n- [[snippets|Snippets]]\n- [[lists/tools collection|Tools Collection]]\n- [[lists/Wishlist|Wishlist]]\n- [[lists/words collection|Words Collection]]\n\n{{\u003c/columns\u003e}}\n\n\u003e[!info] About the Website\n\u003e\n\u003eForgetful Notes is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and themed with [Amethyst](https://github.com/64bitpandas/amethyst), a free alternative to [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) that is derived from two existing projects, [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and [Hugo Book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book).

It is also known as divining, doodle bugging, water finding, well witching. The motion of such dowsing devices is generally attributed to the ideomotor phenomenon, a psychological response where a subject makes motions unconsciously. Put simply, dowsing rods respond to the user's accidental or involuntary movements. Scientific evidence shows that dowsing is no more effective than random chance. It is therefore regarded as a pseudoscience. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowsing).\n\n### Gribble\n\n\u003e Small marine isopod. Feeds on algae, driftwood, and submerged wood of docks and wharves. Up to 10mm in length. Gribbles have an organ called the hepatopancreas that extends almost the entire length of their bodies, where they make their own enzymes. Researchers hope to learn ways to improve the process of turning biomass into liquid fuels by studying gribbles. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gribble).\n\n### Hypervitaminosis A — Polar Bear Liver Toxicity\n\n\u003e An excess of the vitamin that can be contracted from eating the liver of polar bears, seals and walrus. Affecting the central nervous system, it can cause hair loss, extreme peeling of the skin, birth defects, liver problems, vomiting, blurred vision and even death. One officer swore never again to eat bear liver, no matter how much it might tempt him, after his crew showed symptoms akin to carbon monoxide poisoning. Native peoples have long been aware of this danger, as have explorers, though some felt no worse after eating the liver.

Known as the Nubian pyramids, ancient Kushite kingdoms built these drawing heavy influence from the Egyptians. Built some 1,000 years after Egyptian burial methods had changed.\n\n### Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation\n\n\u003e Noninvasive form of brain stimulation in which a changing magnetic field is used to induce an electric current at a specific area of the brain through electromagnetic induction. An electric pulse generator, or stimulator, is connected to a magnetic coil connected to the scalp. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation).\n\n### Turf Toe\n\n\u003e A metatarsophalangeal joint sprain is an injury to the connective tissue between the foot and a toe (at a metatarsophalangeal joint, one of the joints in the ball of the foot).

These lines represent the strings of the guitar. The bottom line is the 6th string (the thickest string on your guitar, low e) and the top line is the thinnest string (the first string, high e).\n\n###  Arpeggio\n\nAn [[../notes/arpeggio|arpeggio]] is a type of [[../notes/chords|broken chord]] in which the notes that compose a chord are individually sounded in a progressive rising or descending order.

The third note is the 5th fret 4th string. By now you are probably realizing that in order to play this riff, you need to use your 3rd finger on the 7th fret and your first finger on the 5th fret.\n\nYou can then finish out the riff by grabbing the 6th fret on the 6th string with your second finger, then the 5th fret with your 1st finger, and finally the 7th fret 5th string (a string) with your 3rd finger.\n\n## Sources\n\n- [ultimate-guitar.com](https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/metallica/enter-sandman-tabs-8595  )\n- [guitarlessons.org](https://www.guitarlessons.org/lessons/read-guitar-tabs/)","lastmodified":"2023-06-21T18:14:31.488164821Z","tags":[]},"/learning/Story-Structure":{"title":"Story Structure","content":"\n## Story Structure 101: Super Basic Shit\n*By Dan Harmon*\n\nStorytelling comes naturally to humans, but since we live in an unnatural world, we sometimes need a little help doing what we'd naturally do.\n\n1. Draw a circle and divide it in half vertically.\n2. Divide the circle again horizontally.\n3. Starting from the 12 o clock position and going clockwise, number the 4 points where the lines cross the circle: 1, 3, 5 and 7.\n4. Number the quarter-sections themselves 2, 4, 6 and 8.\n\nHere we go, down and dirty:\n\n- A character is in a zone of comfort\n- But they want something\n- They enter an unfamiliar situation\n- Adapt to it\n- Get what they wanted\n- Pay a heavy price for it\n- Then return to their familiar situation\n- Having changed\n\nStart thinking of as many of your favorite movies as you can, and see if they apply to this pattern. Now think of your favorite party anecdotes, your most vivid dreams, fairy tales, and listen to a popular song (the music, not necessarily the lyrics). Get used to the idea that stories follow that pattern of descent and return, diving and emerging. Demystify it. See it everywhere. Realize that it's hardwired into your nervous system, and trust that in a vacuum, raised by wolves, your stories would follow this pattern.\n\nI will talk in greater detail about this pattern in subsequent tutorials.\n\n## Story Structure 102: Pure, Boring Theory\nThis isn't a tutorial. It's just a bunch of theory. The pragmatic or impatient among you can skip this one.\n\nWhy this ritual of descent and return? Why does a story have to contain certain elements, in a certain order, before the audience will even recognize it as a story?\n\nBecause our society, each human mind within it and all of life itself has a rhythm, and when you play in that rhythm, it resonates.\n\n### The Rhythm of Biology\n\nThe universe around us is dying, moving from a state of high energy to low. On Earth, however, things tend to move in a contrary direction. Eggs turn into chickens. People turn into more people. Flesh heals, stupid becomes smarter, and the planet, once cold and empty, is now so full of life that you can't leave bread on the counter. How has life managed to cheat a dying universe like this?\n\nThrough death.\n\nThis planetwide creature known as \"Life on Earth\" has been able to grow and thrive through an evolutionary arms race between the various parts of itself. The more advanced parts of life EAT the less advanced parts, thereby becoming more plentiful until a more advanced part consumes it. This causes all life to advance and spread. The ongoing battle between eaters and eaten is responsible for that state-of-the-art biological weapon you call a brain, and it may even lead, one day, to humans flinging themselves like spores, to dead planets and bringing those planets to life.\n\nTo you and me, consciously, death may be a bummer, but to Mother Gaia, to life itself, unconsciously, it is absolutely essential- 50% of how shit gets done.\n\nWhat do I mean by consciously and unconsciously?\n\n### The Rhythm of Psychology\n\nYour mind is a home, with an upstairs and a downstairs.\n\nUpstairs, in your consciousness, things are well-lit and regularly swept. Friends visit. Scrabble is played, hot cocoa is brewing. It is a pleasant, familiar place.\n\nDownstairs, it is older, darker and much, much freakier. We call this basement the unconscious mind.\n\nThe unconscious is exactly what it sounds like: It's the stuff you don't, won't and/or can't think about. According to Freud, there are dirty pictures of your mother down there. According to Jung, there are pipes, wires, even tunnels down there that connect your home to others. And even though it contains life-sustaining energies (like the fuse box and water heater), it's a primitive, stinky, scary place and it's no wonder that, given the choice, we don't hang out down there.\n\nHowever, your pleasure, your sanity and even your life depend on occasional round trips. You've got to change the fuses, grab the Christmas ornaments, clean the litter box. To the extent that we keep the basement door sealed, the entire home becomes unstable. The creatures downstairs get louder and the guy upstairs (your ego) tries to cover the noise with neurotic behavior. For some, eventually, the basement door can come right off its hinges and the slimy, primal denizens of the deep can become Scrabble partners. You might call this a nervous breakdown or psychotic break, it doesn't matter. The point is: Occasional ventures by the ego into the unconscious, through therapy, meditation, confession, sex, violence, or a good story, keep the consciousness in working order.\n\nThis is the rhythm of psychology: Conscious-unconscious-conscious-unconscious-etc.\n\n### The Rhythm of Society\n\nSocieties are basically macrocosms (big versions) of people, only instead of \"consciousness,\" a society's upstairs is \"order,\" and its basement is \"chaos.\"\n\nWhereas the health of an individual depends on the ego's regular descent and return to and from the unconscious, a society's longevity depends on actual people journeying into the unknown and returning with ideas.\n\nIn their most dramatic, revolutionary form, these people are called heroes, but every day, society is replenished by millions of people diving into darkness and emerging with something new (or forgotten): scientists, painters, teachers, dancers, actors, priests, athletes, architects and most importantly, me, Dan Harmon.\n\nSocieties are macrocosms of people in another way: Eventually, they die. There is competition between different societies. The losers are eaten and the winners reproduce.\n\nLike people, societies become neurotic and can eventually break down when they make the mistake of thinking the downstairs shouldn't exist. America is a terrific example of this, as our fear of the unknown continues to create more unknowns and more fear. It's now punishable by bombing to have a problem with America's bombing policy. In a human being, the equivalent would be diagnosable as symptomatic. Our basement is brimming with creepy crawlies, the pressure on the door is building. There has never been a bigger need for heroes and they have never been in such scarcity.\n\nOne of two things is going to happen. Someone's going to open that door and go down there, or that door is going fly off its hinges. Either way, social evolution will not be cheated of its rhythm and it's going to get sloppy. We all know it. We all walk around with that instinctive understanding in our unconscious minds.\n\nThe rhythm of society: Order-chaos-order-chaos-etc.\n\n#### Resonance\nNow you understand that all life, including the human mind and the communities we create, marches to the same, very specific beat. If your story also marches to this beat- whether your story is the great American novel or a fart joke- it will resonate. It will send your audience's ego on a brief trip to the unconscious and back. Your audience has an instinctive taste for that, and they're going to say \"yum.\"\n\nWe'll get back to the nuts and bolts in the next one, elaborating greatly on the circular model and applying it to the 5 minute Channel 101 pilot.\n\n## Story Structure 103: Let's Simplify Before Moving On\n\nHere are those steps from tutorial 101 again, boiled down to the barest minimum I can manage while still speaking English:\n\nWhen you\nhave a need,\nyou go somewhere,\nsearch for it,\nfind it,\ntake it,\nthen return\nand change things.\n\nLess focus on English, more on importance:\n\nYou\nNeed\nGo\nSearch\nFind\nTake\nReturn\nCHANGE\n\nSounds like a caveman giving you an order. That's what it is. Behind (and beneath) your culture creating forebrain, there is an older, simpler monkey brain with a lot less to say and a much louder voice. One of the few things it's telling you, over and over again, is that you need to go search, find, take and return with change. Why? Because that is how the human animal has kept from going extinct, it's how human societies keep from collapsing and how you keep from walking into McDonald's with a machine gun.\n\nIf you were hired to write a script for a race of super-evolved spiders, you might find that they prefer a more linear model. In the spider version of Jack and the Beanstalk, Jack might build his own beanstalk, find a sandwich at the top of it, eat some and save some for later. The End. That's not really inspiring to us. We like us some circles. We like big ones, we like little ones, and given the choice, we'll take a shitty one over a lack of one, but, unless you're writing for some other species, it will pay for you to keep things fairly round.\n\nJack goes up the beanstalk, Jack finds some cool shit, Jack steals it, runs back down, and gives it to his Mom.\n\nWe need go search- We need get fire, we need good woman, we need land moon- but most importantly, we need RETURN and we need CHANGE, because we are a community, and if our heroes just climbed beanstalks and never came down, we wouldn't have survived our first ice age.\n\nI know you still don't believe this has anything to do with your five minute episode of \"Laser Fart.\" Hang in there. The goods are next.\n\n## Story Structure 104: The Juicy Details\nOkay, here's that part where the self appointed guru tells you exactly what needs to happen and when.\n\nI hope I've made it clear to you before I do that that the REAL structure of any good story is simply circular - a descent into the unknown and eventual return - and that any specific descriptions of that process are specific to you and your story.\n\nHere is my detailed description of the steps on the circle. I'm going to get really specific, and I'm not going to bother saying, \"there are some exceptions to this\" over and over. There are some exceptions to everything, but that's called style, not structure.\n\n### 1. \"You.\" - Establish a Protagonist\nThe audience is floating freely, like a ghost, until you give them a place to land.\n\nThis free floating effect can be exploited for a while - closing in on the planet Earth; panning across a dirty shed. Who are we going to be? But sooner or later, we need to be someone, because if we are not inside a character, then we are not inside the story.\n\nHow do you put the audience into a character? Easy. Show one. You'd have to go out of your way to keep the audience from imprinting on them. It could be a raccoon, a homeless man or the President. Just fade in on them and we are them until we have a better choice.\n\nIf there are choices, the audience picks someone to whom they relate. When in doubt, they follow their pity. Fade in on a raccoon being chased by a bear, we are the raccoon. Fade in on a room full of ambassadors. The President walks in and trips on the carpet. We are the President. When you feel sorry for someone, you're using the same part of your brain you use to identify with them.\n\nLots of modern stories bounce us from character to character in the beginning until we finally settle in some comfortable shoes. The bouncing can be effective, but if it's going on for more than 25% of your total story, you're going to lose the audience. Like anything adhesive, our sense of identity weakens a little every time it's switched or tested. The longer it's been stuck on something, the more jarring it's going to be to yank it away and stick it on someone else.\n\nI wouldn't fuck around if I were you. The easiest thing to do is fade in on a character that always does what the audience would do. He can be an assassin, he can be a raccoon, he can be a parasite living in the racoon's liver, but have him do what the audience might do if they were in the same situation. In Die Hard, we fade in on John McClaine, a passenger on an airplane who doesn't like to fly.\n\n### 2. \"Need\" - Something Ain't Quite Right\nAnd now the roller coaster car heads up the first hill. Click, click, click….\n\nThis is where we demonstrate that something is off balance in the universe, no matter how large or small that universe is. If this is a story about a war between Earth and Mars, this is a good time to show those Martian ships heading toward our peaceful planet. On the other hand, if this is a romantic comedy, maybe our heroine is at dinner, on a bad blind date.\n\nWe're being presented with the idea that things aren't perfect. They could be better. This is where a character might wonder out loud, or with facial expressions, why he can't be cooler, or richer, or faster, or a better lover. This wish will be granted in ways that character couldn't have expected.\n\nIt's also where a more literal, exterior \"Call to adventure\" could come in, at the hands of a mysterious messenger, explaining to a dry cleaner that he has been drafted by the CIA.\n\nFrequently, the protagonist \"refuses the call.\" He doesn't want to go to step 3. He's happy as a dry cleaner (at least he thinks he is). The \"refusal of the call\" is not a necessary ingredient, it's just another oft-used trick to keep us buckled into an identity. We're all scared of change.\n\nRemember: Calls to adventure don't have to come from an actual messenger and wishes don't have to be made out loud.\n\nFade in on a meek-looking man driving a car. It's raining. Boom. Flat tire. He struggles to keep the car from ditching. He pulls it to the side of the road and stops. He's got fear on his face. He looks out his car window at the pounding rain…\n\nOr to continue with Die Hard: We realize now that John's marriage is rocky. His wife got a nice job in L.A. and he refused to come here with her. Now he's visiting for Christmas. She's using her maiden name in the corporate directory. They're bickering. Things are not right, and if you could read the protagonist's mind, you might find him wishing there was something he could do to save his marriage…\n\n### 3. \"Go\" - Crossing the Threshold\nWhat's your story about? If it's about a woman running from a killer cyborg, then up until now, she has not been running from a killer cyborg. Now she's gonna start. If your story is about an infatuation, this might be the point where our male hero first lays eyes on the object of his desire. Then again, if our protagonist is the object of a dangerous obsession, the infatuation could have been step 2 and this could be the point where the guy says something really, really creepy to her in the office hall. If it's a coming of age story, this could be a first kiss or the discovery of an armpit hair. If it's a slasher film, this is the first kill, or the discovery of a corpse.\n\nThe key is, figure out what your \"movie poster\" is. What would you advertise to people if you wanted them to come listen to your story? A killer shark? Outer space? The Mafia? True love? Everything in grey on that circle, the bottom half, is a \"special world\" where that movie poster starts being delivered, and everything above this line is the \"ordinary world.\" Step 1, you are the sheriff of a small town. Step 2, strange bites on a murder victim's body. Step 3, holy shit, it's a werewolf.\n\nRemember from tutorial 102 that what's really happening here is a journey into our own unconscious mind, where we can get our shit worked out. A child wakes up and now he's Tom Hanks. His wish to be \"big\" has been granted. Terrorists attack the Christmas party, and now John McClaine has his chance to literally save his rocky marriage. Neo wakes up in a vat of goo in a world ruled by machines. His ordinary world desire to be a hacker, to fight the system, is going to be put to the test. A suicidal boy starts seeing a therapist. We're going to find out why he tried to kill himself.\n\nIt doesn't matter how small or large the scope of your story is, what matters is the amount of contrast between these worlds. In our story about the man changing his tire in the rain, up until now, he wasn't changing a tire. He was inside a dry car. Now, he opens his car door and steps into the pouring rain. The adventure, regardless of its size or subtlety, has begun.\n\n### 4. \"Search\" - The Road of Trials\nChristopher Vogler calls this phase of a feature script \"friends, enemies and allies.\" Hack producers call it the \"training phase.\" I prefer to stick with Joseph Campbell's title, \"The Road of Trials,\" because it's less specific. I've seen too many movies where our time is wasted watching a hero literally \"train\" in a forest clearing because someone got the idea it was a necessary ingredient. The point of this part of the circle is, our protagonist has been thrown into the water and now it's sink or swim.\n\nIn Hero with a Thousand Faces, Campbell actually evokes the image of a digestive tract, breaking the hero down, divesting him of neuroses, stripping him of fear and desire. There's no room for bullshit in the unconscious basement. Asthma inhalers, eyeglasses, credit cards, fratty boyfriends, promotions, toupees and cell phones can't save you here. The purpose here has become refreshingly - and frighteningly - simple.\n\nIn Romancing the Stone, Michael Douglas cuts the heels off of Kathleen Turner's expensive shoes with a machete. Then he throws her suitcase off a cliff. If she's going to continue to survive in this jungle, she literally needs to drop her excess baggage and lose the fancy pants.\n\nIn Die Hard, John McClaine is advised by a terrorist to whom he earlier showed mercy: \"The next time you have a chance to kill someone, don't hesitate.\" John shoots him several times and thanks his corpse for the advice. The cop has begun to fall away, piece by piece, revealing his inner cowboy.\n\nThe man in the pouring rain opens his trunk, revealing a pile of laundry and fast food garbage. He tries moving it around, but finally his frustration takes over and he begins tossing things over his shoulder, emptying the contents of his trunk on the side of the road.\n\nWe are headed for the deepest level of the unconscious mind, and we cannot reach it encumbered by all that crap we used to think was important.\n\n### 5. \"Find\" - Meeting with the Goddess\nThe road of trial's job is to prepare your protagonist for this meeting. Like a single sperm cell arriving at the egg, your hero-in-the-making just found what they were looking for, even if it's not quite what they knew they were looking for.\n\nI'm using the phrase \"meeting with the goddess\" because Joseph Campbell thought about these things longer and harder than me. Syd Field calls this \"the mid point.\" Catchy. Robert McKee probably calls it \"the nexus of inclination\" or something. Unless I'm mistaken, African Americans call it Kwanza.\n\nWhatever you call it, this is a very, very special pivot point. If you look at the circle, you see I've placed the goddess at the very bottom, right in the center. Imagine your protagonist began at the top and has tumbled all the way down here. This is where the universe's natural tendency to pull your protagonist downward has done its job, and for X amount of time, we experience weightlessness. Anything goes down here. This is a time for major revelations, and total vulnerability. If you're writing a plot-twisty thriller, twist here and twist hard.\n\nTwist or no, this is also another threshold, in that everything past this point will take a different direction (namely UPWARD), but note that one is not dragged kicking and screaming through these curtains. One hovers here. One will make a choice, then ascend.\n\nImagine that you're standing on a pier (1). You see a glimmer through the water and you wonder what it is (2). While leaning to see, you fall off the pier (3). You sink down, deeper and deeper (4) until you come to the floor of the lake and see what was catching the sun's rays.\n\n(5) It's a human skull.\n(5) It's a necklace.\n(5) It's a tiny, ancient space craft.\n(5) It's a quarter. Net worth: 25 cents.\n\nIt could be anything, good or bad. A lot of times, it's a healthy dose of both. In a hard-boiled detective story, or a James Bond adventure, this could be a more literal, intimate \"meeting,\" if you know what I mean, with a powerful, mysterious female character. This is a great time for sex or making out with the hot chick, especially if your protagonist has been kung-fuing everybody he meets for the past half hour (or, in Channel 101's case, for the past 60 seconds).\n\nBut the goddess doesn't have to be a femme fatale or an angelic damsel. In an all-male or all-female play that takes place around a poker table, the \"goddess\" could be a character's confession that they lost their job. The goddess can be a gesture, an idea, a gun, a diamond, a destination, or just a moment's freedom from that monster that won't stop chasing you.\n\nIn Die Hard, John McClaine, having run over broken glass, is sitting in a bathroom, soaking his bloody feet in the sink. It is at this moment that he finally realizes the true extent of his love for his wife, and what he's been doing wrong in their marriage. He (1) has been too stubborn (2). He uses his walkie talkie, acquired in step (4), to give a message to his wife through his benevolent, happily married, gun-shy counterpart: \"She's heard me say 'I love you' a thousand times…but she's never heard me say I'm sorry.\"\n\nIt's not enough to hack and slash your way through symbol after neurotic symbol. The hacking and slashing was a process, that process is over, if only temporarily, and we have reached a second major turn.\n\nThe definition of \"major\" being, of course, in relation to your circle's diameter. Our stranded, rain soaked driver has finished emptying the contents of his trunk on the side of the road. He sees the spare tire and he lets out a very slight, very fast sound of relief. That's all. This is a story about a man changing a tire. That's all the goddess we need.\n\nYou might have noticed that, just as (3), the crossing of the threshold, is the opposite of (7) the return, (5), the meeting with the goddess, is the opposite of (1), the protagonist's zone of comfort. Think of (1) as being the arms of mother, however dysfunctional she might be. (5) is a new form of mother, an unconscious version, and there is often a temptation to stay right here. Like at that elf guy's house in Lord of the Rings.\n\nThis is very, very important. Movement beyond (5) becomes the protagonist's volition. The water where the sirens sang their seductive song was littered with wrecked ships. The goddess can be the undoing, or the permanent pacification, of non-heroes. It's all fine and well for James Bond to dip his noodle, but he can't lay around here all day. Electropussy might kill him with her flamethrowing lipstick or something.\n\nIn (1), we were in the arms of the mother, but were removed by (2), the pull of the father. The need, the longing, the lack of completion, either coming from within or without, drew us to (3) and we were pulled across a threshold into the unknown. We were then transformed (4) into (5), the opposite of a mama's boy: A lady's man.\n\nTo reiterate, this doesn't only apply to stories about men having sex. If this is a story of a poor little girl (1) who dreamt of being rich (2) and got adopted by a millionaire (3), having become accustomed to her new lifestyle, (4), she might now be something of a fancy pants (5). Show it with a defineable moment. This might be a good point for her to drive by the orphanage in her limousine.\n\n### 6. \"Take\" - Meet Your Maker\nAs you might expect with a circular model like this, there is a lot of symmetry going on, and on the journey back upward, we're going to be doing a lot of referencing to the journey downward.\n\nJust as (1) and (5) are very maternal, feminine, vulnerable moments, (2) and (6) are very paternal, masculine, active moments, regardless of the protagonist's gender.\n\nThink about what really happened at (2). Things were \"fine\" at (1) but they just weren't quite good enough. That's how we got into this whole mess in the first place.\n\nIn Real Genius (I'm really drawing on the classics, now), the dorky kid (1) is recruited for a special college program that's working on a powerful laser (2). He becomes the roommate of a wayward genius whose major is how-to-parrrrrtay (3). Party man teaches Dork how to relax while Dork teaches party man how to focus (4) and as a result, they are able to perfect their laser (5) and get their prestigious accolades. But now a second, more honest call to adventure from an uber-nerd who lives in the steam tunnels: What is that laser for? Why did they have to build it to certain specifications? What did that creepy, popcorn-hating professor have in mind? Sure, they could stay here in this pizza parlor, nursing at the tit of their own prosperity. But then again, they didn't get this far by being irresponsible. It's time to start heading back up to the real world and making things right, Genius style.\n\nThere are major, major consequences to that decision. In fact, in a good action movie, this is where our guy simply gets his ass kicked. Robocop, armed with Clarence Boddiker's confession (5), marches into the office of Dick Jones, CEO of the company that built him. He tries to arrest the man that owns him, only to discover that he can't. It's against his programming. Loveable, human Alex Murphy (2) might have been able to pull this off, but bullet-proof, factory-made Robocop can't. Ironic, considering that Murphy's unconscious wish (2) was to be a bulletproof hero (\"TJ Laser\"). Between his purely mechanical brother, ED-209, and his purely human brothers, the misinformed police, being sicked on him, Robocop barely makes it out of the father's castle in one piece.\n\nLest you think moments like this are reserved for action films, let's look at a nearly identical scene, which happens to be in Network, which may be the best written film ever made. At this stage of that story, Howard Beale, news anchor turned prophet, is ushered into a board room, where he comes face to face with his creator: CEO of the company that owns the network, Arthur Jensen (played by Ned Beatty). In one of the best written, best performed monologues of the 20th century, Jensen reveals to Beale that capitalism is God, God is capitalism, and having fucked with God, Beale must now atone.\n\nNo robots, no explosions, same structure.\n\nThat's because this half of the circle has its own road of trials - the road back up. The one down prepares you for the bed of the goddess and the one up prepares you to rejoin the ordinary world.\n\nHaving made his peace (5) regarding his marriage, John McClaine now wonders why Hans Gruber, head terrorist, was so desperate for those detonators. He goes back to the roof and discovers that the entire upper portion of the skyscraper is wired to blow. With this realization comes the consequence (6): The giant blonde terrorist - the ED-209 to McClaine's Robocop- descends on him and the two will now battle to the death. Dispatching Blondie is only the first step. The trials on this road come fast and furious. By the time the protagonist gets to (7), the last remaining shreds of his ego will have disappeared and he will have accomplished what Campbell calls the \"Atonement with the Father-\" The father being this completely non-personal, no-bullshit universe, usually embodied, in action films, by the bad guy (who is often heard to say, in these more arch films, \"Nothing personal. Just business.\")\n\nIn a love story, this is the part where they break up. Now comes the stubble and the dirty dishes and the closed shades. The deep, deep, suicidal depression. The boring relationship with the supposedly better partner. And finally, the realization that nothing was ever more important than him or her.\n\nWhen you realize that something is important, really important, to the point where it's more important than YOU, you gain full control over your destiny. In the first half of the circle, you were reacting to the forces of the universe, adapting, changing, seeking. Now you have BECOME the universe. You have become that which makes things happen. You have become a living God.\n\nDepending on the scope of your story, a \"living God\" might be a guy that can finish changing a tire in the rain. Or, in the case of Die Hard, it might be a guy that can appear on the roof, dispatch terrorists with ease and herd 50 hostages to safety while dodging gunfire from an FBI helicopter.\n\n### 7. \"Return\" - Bringing It Home\nFor some characters, this is as easy as hugging the scarecrow goodbye and waking up. For others, this is where the extraction team finally shows up and pulls them out- what Campbell calls \"Rescue from Without.\" In an anecdote about having to change a flat tire in the rain, this could be the character getting back into his car.\n\nFor others, not so easy, which is why Campbell also talks about \"The Magic Flight.\"\n\nThe denizens of the deep can't have people sauntering out of the basement any more than the people upstairs wanted you going down there in the first place. The natives of the conscious and unconscious worlds justify their actions however they want, but in the grand scheme, their goal is to keep the two worlds separate, which includes keeping people from seeing one and living to tell about it.\n\nThis is a great place for a car chase. Or, in a love story, having realized what's important, the hero bursts out of his apartment onto the sidewalk. His lover's airplane leaves for Antartica in TEN MINUTES! John McClaine, who at step (1) was afraid of flying, now wraps a fire hose around his waist and leaps off an exploding building, then shoots a giant window so he can kick through it with his bloody feet.\n\nStrangely enough, he will soon find himself back in the same room where the Christmas party was being held.\n\n### 8. \"Change\" - Master of Both Worlds\nIn an action film, you're guaranteed a showdown here. In a courtroom drama, here comes the disruptive, sky-punching cross examination that leaves the murderer in a tearful confession. In a love story, the man runs across the tarmac, stops the taxiing airplane, gets on board and says to his lover:\n\n\"When I first met you, I thought you were perfect. And then I got used to you being perfect, and everything was perfect, but then I found out you weren't perfect, and we broke up, and then I realized, I'm not perfect, either. Nobody's perfect, and I don't want a perfect person, I just want you. Let's move in together. I'll sleep on the wet spot. You can keep your cat, I'll take allergy medicine. And when you're a hundred years old, I'll clean the shit out of your diaper.\"\n\nAnd then, of course, the old woman and/or large black man seated next to the love interest looks at her and says, \"Well, what are you waiting for? Go to him!\"\n\nWhy this strange reaction from old women and large black men? Because the protagonist, on whatever scale, is now a world-altering ninja. They have been to the strange place, they have adapted to it, they have discovered true power and now they are back where they started, forever changed and forever capable of creating change. In a love story, they are able to love. In a Kung Fu story, they're able to Kung all of the Fu. In a slasher film, they can now slash the slasher.\n\nOne really neat trick is to remind the audience that the reason the protagonist is capable of such behavior is because of what happened down below. When in doubt, look at the opposite side of the circle. Surprise, surprise, the opposite of (8) is (4), the road of trials, where the hero was getting his shit together. Remember that zippo the bum gave him? It blocked the bullet! It's hack, but it's hack because it's worked a thousand times. Grab it, deconstruct it, create your own version. You didn't seem to have a problem with that formula when the stuttering guy (4) recited a perfect monologue (8) in Shakespeare in Love. It's all the same. Remember that tribe of crazy, comic relief Indians that we befriended at (4) by kicking their biggest wrestler in the nuts? It is now, at (8), as we are nearly beaten by the bad guy, that those crazy sons of bitches ride over the hill and save us. Why is this not Deus Ex Machina? Because we earned it (4).\n\nEveryone thinks the Matrix was successful because of new, American special effects combined with old Hong Kong bootleg style. Those things didn't hurt, but for an example of how well they deliver on their own, watch the fucking sequel. Admit it, it stinks. The writers of the Matrix say in interviews that they assembled The Matrix from elements of their favorite films. They tried to make the movie that they always wanted to see. Ta da. They surrendered to their instincts, to what they knew worked, and as a result, they did what humans do instinctively: They told an instinctively satisfying story about an everyday guy (1) that gets a weird call (2) and, upon following it, realizes that reality was an illusion (3). He learns the ropes (4), talks to the oracle (5), loses his mentor (6), goes back (7) and saves the fucking day (8). It's not perfect, especially in the third act, but try identifying the steps in Matrix Reloaded. Get a slide rule. And a cup of coffee. It's going to be a long, hard slog.\n\nIn Die Hard, having killed every terrorist - each time dropping more and more neurotic luggage, McClaine now stands, unarmed, nearly naked, before his wife. There's only one problem. Hans Gruber, the unconscious shadow version of John (is \"Hans\" German for \"John?\"), is also here, having \"followed\" him up to the ordinary world, as shadows are prone to do. He's got a gun to her head. And, he's got one more goon - you know, the guy that played \"Nick the Dick\" in Bachelor Party (who would've thought he'd last the longest?)\n\nSometimes Boss Hog doesn't stop at the county line. Sometimes the alien sneaks aboard your escape pod, or the T-Rex starts walking through people's back yards. This is especially liable to happen in more action-oriented life and death stories, where the crossing of the return threshold was down and dirty. Things can get sloppy. You can drag a little more chaos than you wanted through the portal. Worlds can collide. Like Ullyses, coming home to find 50 guys trying to bang his wife, it's time to clean house.\n\nFortunately, the real John has spent his storytime learning new behaviors, while Shadow John has spent his storytime attempting to cling to his crumbling ego. Real John has learned, in particular, that sometimes your best offense is surrender. He came around the corner with his otherworldly submachine gun, and was ordered to drop it. Now Shadow John, at (8) thinks he has what was so desperately necessary to Real John at (1): Control. He has John's wife as an unwilling hostage. And, of course, like a good villain, Hans would never dream of throwing away the opportunity to gloat as he levels his gun on John.\n\nBut John's SMG was empty. He had placed his last two bullets from the unconscious world back into his old, conscious, New York penis pistol, the one he had on the plane, the one that is now taped to his back with ..(blush) Christmas tape. Okay, look, it's a pretty good script up until that point. Anyways, John pulls the concealed gun, shoots Shadow John through his black, uncompromising, German heart, shoots Nick the Dick in the forehead, and, as his wife and Hans nearly both tumble through the broken window, John is able to release his love once and for all by releasing the clasp on the Rolex given to her by an L.A. cokehead yuppy. The watch, and Hans, tumble through the air, the principal from Breakfast Club says \"I hope that's not a hostage,\" and so concludes the 20th century's greatest action film.\n\nWell, not quite. The proper, jive talking, submissive, comic relief black chaueffer has to punch out the improper, hyperintelligent, uppity black computer hacker, thereby making slavery more heroic than terrorism and restoring security to caucasian society. Also, the child-murdering, gun-shy L.A. cop has to blow away the freshly resurrected Blonde terrorist, reacquainting himself with the fact that sometimes, killing the right type of person can be a life affirming act.\n\nMeanwhile, our tire-changing hero starts his car and heads home, with a story to tell his wife.\n\nA good story? Worthy of TV or movies? Of course not. But the tire-changing story uses the barest minimums. Contrast it with one in which, after the man pulls his car to the side of the road, a werewolf opens the door and eats him. The end. Now, you have one sequence with a werewolf in it and one without. Which tells a story? It doesn't matter how cool you think werewolves are, you know the answer instinctively.\n\nYou know all of this instinctively. You are a storyteller. You were born that way.\n\n## Story Structure 105: How TV is Different\nTelevision really is no different, except in one, very practical sense:\n\nA feature film's job is to send you out of the theater on a high in 90 minutes. Television's job is to keep you glued to the television for your entire life.\n\nThis does not entail making stories any less circular (TV circles are so circular they're sometimes irritatingly predictable). It just means that the focus of step (8) is less riling-things-up and more getting-things-back-to-where-they-started.\n\nMovies can afford to blow up the Death Star at the end. In a sitcom version of Star Wars, however, the protagonist would be a desk clerk working in the hangar bay at Rebel headquarters. In a dramatic series, he'd be an X-wing pilot constantly making raids on the Death Star. But note that in both the sitcom and dramatic TV version of Star Wars, the Death Star stays. If not, the show would end.\n\nThe pilot episode of a TV show usually tells the story of a person entering a new situation. New job, new marriage, divorce, just got out of college, adopted a black person, started spinning cities, sainting elsewheres or willing graces. I'd be really bad at examples because the only TV I watch is the show my friend is on, \"Happy Family.\" In that show's pilot, the baby boomer husband and wife realize, for the first time, that no matter how old your kids get, they never stop being your kids. The \"new\" situation can be as simple as that, a realization, a theme, the thing that your show is about.\n\nIn a larger scope, a TV pilot is giving us (1), (2) and (3), then encouraging us to tune in and watch (4) for the rest of time. But that's looking at the entire run of the show as a single story. Within the scope of an individual episode, pilot or not, you still have to run a full circle:\n\nI\nnotice a small problem,\nand make a major decision.\nthis changes things\nto some satisfaction, but\nthere are consequences\nthat must be undone\nand I must admit the futility of change.\n\nUninspiring? Yes, but the joy of TV is in the moment. TV isn't selling revolution, it's selling a hygienic, relatable substitution for your own filthy, unmarketable humanity. The stories are just killing time while the voices and faces wear a groove in your brain and the commercials do their hard, hard work.\n\nBut notice how, being required to keep our attention, they have to do so with that circular structure. If we don't get that circle, we'll flip to the next channel.\n\nThe characters must start in the ordinary situation, descend into a new situation, adapt to it, become native to it, pay the price and then flock back to basics having \"changed.\"\n\nThe trick that television plays is that it swaps out any meaningful and therefore potentially television-subverting truth with the basic, eternal \"truth\" that change is unneccessary. \"What did you learn today, Beaver?\" Well, basically, Dad, I learned to never do anything. \"Good boy.\"\n\nThere's nothing sinister about the intent, the intent is just to save money on sets and keep scripts relatively modular. You're the one that wanted a capitalist society. Welcome to the overhead-reducing, profit-maximizing techniques of storytelling for money.\n\nThat's where Channel 101 comes in. We are not so financially encumbered. We are the next stage in entertainment's evolution.\n\n## Story Structure 106: Five Minute Pilots\nI ended my last \"tutorial\" by saying that next, we'd start examining some 101 videos. But it's been such a long time since then, I thought I might respark first with a total review- with an emphasis on the 5 minute time limit.\n\nWhen I talk about \"story structure\" I'm talking about something very scientific, like \"geometry.\" Your story could have \"perfect\" structure, in that it hits all the resonant points craved by the audience mind, but that won't make it a perfect piece of entertainment. Example:\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a thirsty man on a couch. He got up off the couch, went to his kitchen, searched through his refrigerator, found a soda, drank it, and returned to his couch, thirst quenched.\n\nThat was \"perfect story structure.\" On the other hand, the story sucked.\n\nHere's a converse example:\n\nOnce upon a time, a car exploded. A Navy Seal killed a werewolf. Two beautiful naked women had sex with each other, then a robot shot the moon with a Jesus-powered laser. The world became overpopulated by zombies. The End.\n\nLot of exciting, creative stuff happening, but very little structure. Again, boo, but the lesbian scene did give me a boner.\n\nWhat do you want? You want both. You want to be cool, but you're going to be cooler if the structure is there. Cool stuff with no structure is like that perfect scene you recorded when you left the lens cap on. \"Guess you had to be there.\" Show me an army of zombies and I might say \"cool zombies,\" but I'm not going to \"be there.\"\n\nYou also want to make sure everything's lit well, and that the audio is clear, and that the edits are well-timed, and it would be great if you had fantastic actors and a makeup artist and a million other ingredients. But we are not talking about makeup right now, or lighting, acting, editing, or how to come up with cool ideas. We're focusing on one very particular aspect of a video: Its structure, the geometry of its story. A little bit helps a little, a lot helps a LOT, having none can cripple you.\n\nThe thing about Channel 101 that makes it really easy to analyze structure in action: The five minute time limit. That's 300 seconds, 75 seconds per story quarter, 37.5 per step. And what are those steps? Class?\n\nYou\nNeed\nGo\nSearch\nFind\nTake\nReturn\nChange\n\nAs I've said, the easiest way to visualize these steps is by drawing a circle, dividing it into 4 equal pieces, and writing numbers around it clockwise, with (1) and (5) at the north and south \"poles\" of the circle, (3) and (7) at the east and west poles.\n\n1. \"You\" - who are we? A squirrel? The sun? A red blood cell? America? By the end of the first 37 seconds, we'd really like to know.\n2. \"Need\" - something is wrong, the world is out of balance. This is the reason why a story is going to take place. The \"you\" from (1) is an alcoholic. There's a dead body on the floor. A motorcycle gang rolls into town. Campbell phrases: Call to Adventure, Refusal of the Call, Supernatural Aid.\n3. \"Go\" - For (1) and (2), the \"you\" was in a certain situation, and now that situation changes. A hiker heads into the woods. Pearl Harbor's been bombed. A mafia boss enters therapy. Campbell phrase: Crossing of the Threshold. Syd Field phrase: Plot Point 1.\n4. \"Search\" - adapting, experimenting, getting shit together, being broken down. A detective questions suspects. A cowboy gathers his posse. A cheerleader takes a nerd shopping. Campbell phrases: Belly of the Whale, Road of Trials. Christopher Vogler phrase: Friends, Enemies and Allies.\n5. \"Find\" - whether it was the direct, conscious goal or not, the \"need\" from (2) is fulfilled. We found the princess. The suspect gives the location of the meth lab. A nerd achieves popularity. Campbell phrase: Meeting with the Goddess. Syd Field phrase: mid-point. Vogler phrase: Approach to the Innermost Cave.\n6. \"Take\" - The hardest part (both for the characters and for anyone trying to describe it). On one hand, the price of the journey. The shark eats the boat. Jesus is crucified. The nice old man has a stroke. On the other hand, a goal achieved that we never even knew we had. The shark now has an oxygen tank in his mouth. Jesus is dead- oh, I get it, flesh doesn't matter. The nice old man had a stroke, but before he died, he wanted you to take this belt buckle. Now go win that rodeo. Campbell phrases: Atonement with the Father, Death and Resurrection, Apotheosis. Syd Field phrase: plot point 2\n7. \"Return\" - It's not a journey if you never come back. The car chase. The big rescue. Coming home to your girlfriend with a rose. Leaping off the roof as the skyscraper explodes. Campbell phrases: Magic Flight, Rescue from Without, Crossing of the Return Threshold.\n8. \"Change\" - The \"you\" from (1) is in charge of their situation again, but has now become a situation-changer. Life will never be the same. The Death Star is blown up. The couple is in love. Dr. Bloom's Time Belt is completed. Lorraine Bracco heads into the jungle with Sean Connery to \"find some of those ants.\" Campbell phrases: Master of Both Worlds, Freedom to Live.\n\nAGAIN, SAID DIFFERENTLY: If we assume you're going to use your full 5 minutes, then you've got 1 minute and 15 seconds to for these 3 steps:\n\n- Get the audience to identify with someone or something, - Give that someone or something some kind of need, - And start changing the circumstances.\n\nYou've then got another 1:15 to:\n\n- Have that someone or something deal with the new circumstances - And find the thing that was needed.\n\nYou've got another 1:15 to:\n\n- Have that someone or something pay the price of the find - And start heading back toward the original circumstances.\n\nAnd a final 1:15 to:\n\n- show how those original circumstances have changed as a result.\n\nIn TV (including Channel 101), that last quarter is a good time to make it very clear to the audience that you've got a series in mind. More can happen. As a \"situation changer,\" your protagonist is going to be going on more journeys (episodes), creating a viable series or \"franchise.\"\n\nYou want to go nuts? Think of each of the 8 steps as consisting of 8 microcosmic substeps. Because the act of:\n\n(1) Establishing a protagonist\n\ncould be done by showing a guy on a couch for 4 seconds, showing a closeup of his face looking thirsty for 4 seconds, and so on until you've spent 37.5 seconds telling the \"story of the guy that drank a soda.\" Then you could go on to\n\n(2) Establish a need\n\nBy telling the 37.5 second story of \"the guy whose soda turned out to contain poison:\"\n\n(2.1) The guy [you]\n(2.2) Makes a stink face [need]\n(2.3) Starts inspecting the soda can [go]\n(2.4) Runs finger over ingredients [search]\n(2.5) Finds \"poison\" in ingredients [find]\n(2.6) Chokes [take]\n(2.7) Falls down [return]\n(2.8) Dead [change]\n\nIt's all in the context of step 2, but cycling through a mini-circle. Then you could tell the 37.5 second story of him going to heaven, followed by the story of him asking around for God, the story of him finding God, the story of God telling him he can only go back to Earth if he agrees to be a dog, etc.\n\nI'm not recommending that you sit there with a compass and a calculator breaking down your story to the point where every 4 second line of dialogue consists of 8 syllables and tells the story of a sentence, but it's possible and sometimes \"going there\" can help you make decisions or get unblocked.\n\nOn the other hand, you can also just shotgun it. So what if you have to spend an extra 11 seconds making the audience love your main character, at the price of some time from other sections of the story? So what if, in today's world, we really don't need to spend a proportionate amount of time saying \"happily ever after,\" at the expense of less karate? Nobody's going to notice. A confidently hand drawn, vaguely egg-shaped circle can be circular enough.\n\nYou won't win any prizes for being the Phillip Glass of story structure, especially if it starts compromising your creativity. Follow your bliss. If you know what to do, do it. That's called creativity. If you don't know what to do, THEN listen to some guy like me telling you what you HAVE to do.\n\nOkay, that's the review of my story model. And here are some questions it sometimes raises:\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: Why do stories have to follow this structure?\n\nA: It's not that stories have to follow this structure, it's that, without some semblance of this structure, it's not recognizable as a story.\n\nI learned about \"iconography\" from working with Rob Schrab for several years. In cartooning, you have to draw a certain combination of lines before the audience is going to universally recognize what you've drawn.\n\nIf I draw a cylinder, I can tell you it's a banana, but I can't make you think \"banana\" on your own unless I make it yellow, taper the ends and give it some curvature. To further extend this metaphor: Sometimes bananas are green in real life. If I make a green, tapered, curved cylinder, does it look like a banana? It looks like a pepper. You can jump up and down and scream about how you just drew a perfectly good banana, because it looks just as much like a real banana as a yellow one (student filmmaker), but I'm telling you, dude, it's a fucking pepper, UNTIL you put more time and energy into giving it OTHER recognizable banana qualities- for instance, drawing it half peeled. Okay, now it's a green banana. You blew my mind.\n\nLikewise, I'm saying there's 8 steps to \"drawing\" a universally recognizable story. Can you skip some of them? Yep. I do it all the time. The \"road of trials\" in Call me Cobra is a guy sitting down at a table. If I had an extra 30 seconds, I would have written that Steve tries on different outfits and personas, saying \"I'm the Cobra\" in a mirror before deciding on his black suit and going to his meeting with the goddess. But I skipped it. It's implied. The time was needed elsewhere.\n\nQ: Yeah, but why would a human being recognize certain things as stories? I mean, with a banana, we need to know it's a banana so that we know we can eat it. We don't \"eat\" stories.\n\nA: Yes we do, and our survival as individuals and as communities is dependent on recognizing the edible, nutritious ones. Information can be \"empty calories,\" like a phone book, or it can be downright \"poisonous,\" like a Superbowl halftime show, a Madonna video or footage of a man blowing his brains out. The right kinds of poison can get you high and help you have fun, but it's getting you high because it's fucking with you, it's killing you, and if you don't occassionally eat real story food- a dramatic game of football where your favorite team wins, a meaningful conversation with friends you trust, a good book, a good movie, a good TV show, witnessing a life being saved at the public pool- you are going to wither away and die, psychologically, spiritually and socially speaking.\n\nQ: But I'm sick and tired of cookie-cutter stories about good guys saving the day from bad guys. Some of my favorite movies fly in the face of your story model.\n\nA: If it's really your favorite movie, I absolutely guarantee you it's structured at least somewhat in accordance with this model. You're hearing \"good guys and bad guys,\" but I'm not saying it. I'm saying \"protagonist descending and returning.\"\n\nThe very fact that you ARE sick of ordinary movies is evidence that we live and breathe this structure. If you're a subversive punk rock anarchist with a spike through your nose, and you hate \"Shrek\" because it's a piece of corporate shit, you are craving a descent into the unknown. \"You\" are expressing a \"need\" to \"go\" to an obscure film magazine, \"search\" for something unique, \"find\" a gory Japanese horror film, \"take\" it, \"return\" to your apartment with it and use it to \"change\" your friends' minds about cinema. And I think you will find that your \"favorite\" Japanese gore fest is the one with a recognizable protagonist needing to eat human flesh, going to an orgy, eating everyone there, raping a woman, killing the police and jumping out the window before heading into the night.\n\nSchrab has this video we watch all the time: It's an orientation video designed to teach mentally r*****ed girls about their period. The protagonist is a r*****ed girl. She starts asking questions about periods. She's led into a bathroom by her older sister, and after a very uncomfortable road of trials, things take a turn for the bizarre. I won't go into detail. Not only is the protagonist going on a journey, the audience is, too.\n\nI have taken great pains to avoid any ethical positioning in my observations of structure. Stories are not necessarily about love conquering all, they're not about achieving spiritual balance, they're not about \"learning valuable life lessons\" and they're not about maintaining order. They're about change. Subversion of order. By the way, \"Shrek\" had not-so-good structure.\n\nGood structure is the best weapon we can use in the fight against corporate garbage because good structure costs nothing, is instinctive to the individual and important to the audience. For all their money, computers and famous actors, the Hollywood factory is constantly being challenged and often buried by individuals like you, people who started by realizing that they were sick of the shit they were seeing and wrote a good story from the deepest level of their unconscious mind. I am trying to show you how to make your own gunpowder. You can use it to make pretty fireworks or you can use it to blow up a building full of innocent babies, it's not my place to care.\n\nQ: If this stuff is instinctive, why does it have to be \"taught?\" A: Because we don't live in the real world anymore. We are not in tune with our instincts. Babies know how to swim when they're born but some adults sink like a stone until another adult shows them some moves.\n\nQ: If you're so great, why haven't you written anything good? A: Isn't that always the way? I'm not a great writer. I'm just a guy that's been obsessed with story structure for the last seven years, non stop. Like I said at the beginning, perfect structure is not synonymous with \"good show.\" This is about what audiences recognize as stories, not about how to be a good writer.\n\nQ: I disagree with your model, I don't think all stories are required to do this or that. A: Prove me wrong. It'd be a great exercise. Don't have a protagonist. Or do have one, but don't give [it] a need. Or have a protagonist with a need whose circumstances never change. Or have a protagonist with a need enter a new set of circumstances, fail to adapt and never find what they needed. Or have them do everything but return. The first lesson you'll learn is that it's pretty hard to actively defy this story model. As soon as you get in the zone and you're writing something that's making you happy, you're going to realize with horror that you've accidentally nailed one of the story steps at exactly the right time.\n\n*End of Series*\n\n## Sources\n\nHN post: [Ask HN: I'd like to learn how to tell stories better to friends](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34562930)\n\nStory Structure by Dan Harmon series:\n- [Story Structure 101: Super Basic Shit | Channel 101 Wiki | Fandom](https://channel101.fandom.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit)\n- [Story Structure 102: Pure, Boring Theory | Channel 101 Wiki | Fandom](https://channel101.fandom.com/wiki/Story_Structure_102:_Pure,_Boring_Theory)\n- [Story Structure 103: Let's Simplify Before Moving On | Channel 101 Wiki | Fandom](https://channel101.fandom.com/wiki/Story_Structure_103:_Let%27s_Simplify_Before_Moving_On)\n- [Story Structure 104: The Juicy Details | Channel 101 Wiki | Fandom](https://channel101.fandom.com/wiki/Story_Structure_104:_The_Juicy_Details)\n- [Story Structure 105: How TV is Different | Channel 101 Wiki | Fandom](https://channel101.fandom.com/wiki/Story_Structure_105:_How_TV_is_Different)\n- [Story Structure 106: Five Minute Pilots | Channel 101 Wiki | Fandom](https://channel101.fandom.com/wiki/Story_Structure_106:_Five_Minute_Pilots)\n- [Video - Storyline, character building critique on different TV series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUYr55OIJOjDgVtAeD9VyM96BS1qTFKbH)\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-21T18:14:31.488164821Z","tags":[]},"/learning/meditation":{"title":"Meditate","content":"\n![Learn how to meditate](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/q_lossy+w_960+to_avif+ret_img/https://www.mindful.org/content/uploads/how-to-meditate.jpg)\n\n## What is Meditation?\n\n### A Brief Explanation of the Practice\n\nHow do you learn to meditate? In mindfulness meditation, we’re learning how to pay attention to the breath as it goes in and out, and notice when the mind wanders from this task. This practice of returning to the breath builds the muscles of attention and [mindfulness](https://www.mindful.org/what-is-mindfulness/).\n\nWhen we pay attention to our breath, we are learning how to return to, and remain in, the present moment—to anchor ourselves in the here and now on purpose, without judgement.\n\nThe idea behind mindfulness seems simple—the practice takes patience. Indeed, renowned meditation teacher [Sharon Salzberg](https://www.mindful.org/author/sharon-salzberg/) recounts that her first experience with meditation showed her how quickly the mind gets caught up in other tasks. “I thought, okay, what will it be, like, 800 breaths before my mind starts to wander? And to my absolute amazement, it was one breath, and I’d be gone,” says Salzberg.\n\n## Why Learn to Meditate?\n\n### A Selection of Benefits That Are Associated with Meditating\n\nWhile meditation isn’t a cure-all, it can certainly provide some much-needed space in your life. Sometimes, that’s all we need to make better choices for ourselves, our families, and our communities. And the most important tools you can bring with you to your meditation practice are a little patience, some kindness for yourself, and a comfortable place to sit.\n\nWhen we meditate, we inject far-reaching and long-lasting benefits into our lives. And bonus: you don’t need any extra gear or an expensive membership.\n\n### Here Are Five Reasons to Meditate\n\n1. Understanding your pain\n2. Lower your stress\n3. Connect better\n4. Improve focus\n5. Reduce brain chatter\n\n## How to Meditate\n\n### Meditation is Something Everyone Can Do, here’s How\n\nMeditation is simpler (and harder) than most people think. Read these steps, make sure you’re somewhere where you can relax into this process, set a timer, and give it a shot:\n\n1. Take a seat\nFind place to sit that feels calm and quiet to you.\n2. Set a time limit\nIf you’re just beginning, it can help to choose a short time, such as five or 10 minutes.\n3. Notice your body\nYou can sit in a chair with your feet on the floor, you can sit loosely cross-legged, you can kneel—all are fine. Just make sure you are stable and in a position you can stay in for a while.\n4. Feel your breath\nFollow the sensation of your breath as it goes in and as it goes out.\n5. Notice when your mind has wandered\nInevitably, your attention will leave the breath and wander to other places. When you get around to noticing that your mind has wandered—in a few seconds, a minute, five minutes—simply return your attention to the breath.\n6. Be kind to your wandering mind\nDon’t judge yourself or obsess over the content of the thoughts you find yourself lost in. Just come back.\n7. Close with kindness\nWhen you’re ready, gently lift your gaze (if your eyes are closed, open them). Take a moment and notice any sounds in the environment. Notice how your body feels right now. Notice your thoughts and emotions.\n\nYou focus your attention, your mind wanders, you bring it back, and you try to do it as kindly as possible (as many times as you need to).\n\n## How Much Should I Meditate?\n\nMeditation is no more complicated than what we’ve described above. It is that simple … and that challenging. It’s also powerful and worth it. The key is to commit to sit every day, even if it’s for five minutes. Meditation teacher Sharon Salzberg says: “One of my meditation teachers said that the most important moment in your meditation practice is the moment you sit down to do it. Because right then you’re saying to yourself that you believe in change, you believe in caring for yourself, and you’re making it real. You’re not just holding some value like mindfulness or compassion in the abstract, but really making it real.”\n\nRecent research from neuroscientist Amishi Jha discovered that [12 minutes of meditation, 5 days a week](https://www.mindful.org/find-your-focus-own-your-attention-in-12-minutes-a-day/) can protect and strengthen your ability to pay attention.\n\n### Meditation Tips and Techniques\n\nWe’ve gone over the basic breath meditation so far, but there are other mindfulness techniques that use different focal points than the breath to anchor our attention—external objects like a sound in the room, or something broader, such as noticing spontaneous things that come into your awareness during an [aimless wandering practice](https://www.mindful.org/aimless-wandering-mindfulness-practice-video/). But all of these practices have one thing in common: We notice that our minds ARE running the show a lot of the time. It’s true. We think thoughts, typically, and then we act. But here are some helpful strategies to change that up:\n\n### How to Make Mindfulness a Habit\n\nIt’s estimated that 95% of our behavior runs on autopilot. That’s because neural networks underlie all of our habits, reducing our millions of sensory inputs per second into manageable shortcuts so we can function in this crazy world. These default brain signals are so efficient that they often cause us to relapse into old behaviors before we remember what we meant to do instead. \n\nMindfulness is the exact opposite of these default processes. It’s executive control rather than autopilot, and enables intentional actions, willpower, and decisions. But that takes *practice*. The more we activate the intentional brain, the stronger it gets. Every time we do something deliberate and new, we stimulate neuroplasticity, activating our grey matter, which is full of newly sprouted neurons that have not yet been groomed for “autopilot” brain. \n\nBut here’s the problem. While our intentional brain knows what is best for us, our autopilot brain causes us to shortcut our way through life. So how can we trigger ourselves to be mindful when we need it most? This is where the notion of “behavior design” comes in. It’s a way to put your intentional brain in the driver’s seat. There are two ways to do that—first, slowing down the autopilot brain by putting obstacles in its way, and second, removing obstacles in the path of the intentional brain, so it can gain control. \n\nShifting the balance to give your intentional brain more power takes some work, though. Here are some ways to get started. \n\n- **Put meditation reminders around you.** If you intend to do some yoga or to meditate, put your yoga mat or your meditation cushion in the middle of your floor so you can’t miss it as you walk by. \n- **Refresh your reminders regularly.** Say you decide to use sticky notes to remind yourself of a new intention. That might work for about a week, but then your autopilot brain and old habits take over again. Try writing new notes to yourself; add variety or make them funny. That way they’ll stick with you longer. \n- **Create new patterns.** You could try a series of “If this, then that” messages to create easy reminders to shift into the intentional brain. For instance, you might come up with, “If office door, then deep breath,” as a way to shift into mindfulness as you are about to start your workday. Or, “If phone rings, take a breath before answering.” Each intentional action to shift into mindfulness will strengthen your intentional brain.\n\n## Some Basic Meditations\n\n### These Are Some Meditation Practices to Get You Going\n\n## A Basic Meditation for Beginners\n\nThe first thing to clarify: What we’re doing here is aiming for mindfulness, not some process that magically wipes your mind clear of the countless and endless thoughts that erupt and ping constantly in our brains. We’re just practicing bringing our attention to our breath, and then back to the breath when we notice our attention has wandered.\n\n- **Get comfortable** **and prepare to sit still for a few minutes.** After you stop reading this, you’re going to simply focus on your own natural inhaling and exhaling of breath.\n- **Focus on your breath.** Where do you feel your breath most? In your belly? In your nose? Try to keep your attention on your inhale and exhale.\n- **Follow your breath for two minutes**. Take a deep inhale, expanding your belly, and then exhale slowly, elongating the out-breath as your belly contracts.\n\nWelcome back. What happened? How long was it before your mind wandered away from your breath? Did notice how busy your mind was even without your consciously directing it to think about anything in particular? Did you notice yourself getting caught up in thoughts before you came back to reading this? We often have little narratives running in our minds that we didn’t choose to put there, like: “Why DOES my boss want to meet with me tomorrow?” “I should have gone to the gym yesterday.” “I’ve got to pay some bills” or (the classic) “I don’t have time to sit still, I’ve got stuff to do.”\n\nIf you experienced these sorts of distractions (and we all do), you’ve made an important discovery: simply put, that’s the opposite of mindfulness. It’s when we live in our heads, on automatic pilot, letting our thoughts go here and there, exploring, say, the future or the past, and essentially, not being present in the moment. But that’s where most of us live most of the time—and pretty uncomfortably, if we’re being honest, right? But it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWe “practice” mindfulness so we can learn how to recognize when our minds are doing their normal everyday acrobatics, and maybe take a pause from that for just a little while so we can choose what we’d like to focus on. In a nutshell, meditation helps us have a much healthier relationship with ourselves (and, by extension, with others).\n\n### 3 Guided Meditations for Beginners\n\nGuided meditations are an excellent tool for beginners, as they provide a focal point and gentle instruction to help you connect and let go of self-judgment.\n\nTry this 3-part guided audio series from Mindful Editor-in-Chief Barry Boyce:\n\nHow long would you like to meditate? Sometimes we only have time for a quick check-in, sometimes we can dip in a little longer. Meditating every day helps build awareness, fosters resilience, and lower stress. Try to make meditation a habit by practicing with these short meditations from our [founding editor Barry Boyce](https://www.mindful.org/author/barry-boyce/). Find time to site once a day for one month and see what you notice.\n\n### 1-Minute Meditation\n\nA short practice for settling the mind, intended for doing in the middle of the day, wherever you are out in the world.\n\n### 10-Minute Meditation\n\nA longer practice that explores meditation posture, breathing techniques, and working with thoughts and emotions as they surface during mindfulness practice.\n\n### 15-Minute Meditation\n\nA practice that explores sitting in formal meditation for longer periods of time.\n\n#### More Styles of Mindfulness Meditation\n\nOnce you have explored a basic seated meditation practice, you might want to consider other forms of meditation including walking and lying down. Whereas the previous meditations used the breath as a focal point for practice, these meditations below focus on different parts of the body.\n\n#### Introduction to the Body Scan Meditation\n\nTry this: feel your feet on the ground right now. In your shoes or without, it doesn’t matter. Then track or scan over your whole body, bit by bit—slowly—all the way up to the crown of your head. The point of this practice is to check in with your whole body: Fingertips to shoulders, butt to big toe. Only rules are: No judging, no wondering, no worrying (all activities your mind may want to do); just check in with the physical feeling of being in your body. Aches and pains are fine. You don’t have to do anything about anything here. You’re just noticing.\n\n### Body Scan Meditation\n\nA brief body awareness practice for tuning in to sensations, head-to-toe.\n\nBegin to focus your attention on different parts of your body. You can spotlight one particular area or go through a sequence like this: toes, feet (sole, heel, top of foot), through the legs, pelvis, abdomen, lower back, upper back, chest shoulders, arms down to the fingers, shoulders, neck, different parts of the face, and head. For each part of the body, linger for a few moments and notice the different sensations as you focus.\n\nThe moment you notice that your mind has wandered, return your attention to the part of the body you last remember.\n\nIf you fall asleep during this body-scan practice, that’s okay. When you realize you’ve been nodding off, take a deep breath to help you reawaken and perhaps reposition your body (which will also help wake it up). When you’re ready, return your attention to the part of the body you last remember focusing on.\n\n#### Introduction to the Walking Meditation\n\nFact: Most of us live pretty sedentary lives, leaving us to build extra-curricular physical activity into our days to counteract all that. Point is: Mindfulness doesn’t have to feel like another thing on your to-do list. It can be injected into some of the activities you’re already doing. Here’s how to integrate a mindful walking practice into your day.\n\n### Walking Meditation\n\nA mindful movement practice for bringing awareness to what we feel with each step.\n\nAs you begin, walk at a natural pace. Place your hands wherever comfortable: on your belly, behind your back, or at your sides.\n\n- If you find it useful, **you can count steps up to 10**, and then start back at one again. If you’re in a small space, as you reach ten, pause, and with intention, choose a moment to turn around.\n- With each step, **pay attention to the lifting and falling of your foot**. Notice movement in your legs and the rest of your body. Notice any shifting of your body from side to side.\n- Whatever else captures your attention, **come back to the sensation of walking**. Your mind will wander, so without frustration, guide it back again as many times as you need.\n- Particularly outdoors, **maintain a larger sense of the environment around you**, taking it all in, staying safe and aware.\n\n#### Introduction to Loving-Kindness Meditation\n\nYou cannot will yourself into particular feelings toward yourself or anyone else. Rather, you can practice reminding yourself that you deserve happiness and ease and that the same goes for your child, your family, your friends, your neighbors, and everyone else in the world.\n\n### A Loving-Kindness Meditation\n\nExplore this practice to extend compassion to yourself, those around you, and the larger world.\n\nThis loving-kindness practice involves silently repeating phrases that offer good qualities to oneself and to others.\n\n1. **You can start by taking delight in your own goodness**—calling to mind things you have done out of good-heartedness, and rejoicing in those memories to celebrate the potential for goodness we all share.\n2. **Silently recite phrases** that reflect what we wish most deeply for ourselves in an enduring way. Traditional phrases are:\n   - May I live in safety.\n   - May I have mental happiness (peace, joy).\n   - May I have physical happiness (health, freedom from pain).\n   - May I live with ease.\n3. **Repeat the phrases** with enough space and silence between so they fall into a rhythm that is pleasing to you. Direct your attention to one phrase at a time.\n4. **Each time you notice your attention has wandered, be kind to yourself** and let go of the distraction. Come back to repeating the phrases without judging or disparaging yourself.\n5. **After some time, visualize yourself in the center of a circle** composed of those who have been kind to you, or have inspired you because of their love. Perhaps you’ve met them, or read about them; perhaps they live now, or have existed historically or even mythically. That is the circle. As you visualize yourself in the center of it, experience yourself as the recipient of their love and attention. Keep gently repeating the phrases of loving-kindness for yourself.\n6. **To close the session, let go of the visualization**, and simply keep repeating the phrases for a few more minutes. Each time you do so, you are transforming your old, hurtful relationship to yourself, and are moving forward, sustained by the force of kindness.\n\n### Beyond the Beginning\n\n#### What to Know and Where to Go When you’ve Started\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions About Mindfulness Meditation, Answered\n\nWhen you’re new to meditation, it’s natural for questions to pop up often. These answers may ease your mind.\n\n1. If I have an itch, can I scratch it?\nYes—however, first try scratching it with your mind before using your fingers.\n2. Should I breathe fast or slow or in between?\nOnly worry if you’ve stopped breathing. Otherwise, you’re doing fine. Breath in whatever way feels comfortable to you.\n3. Should my eyes be open or closed?\nNo hard-and-fast rules. Try both. If open, not too wide, and with a soft, slightly downward gaze, not focusing on anything in particular. If closed, not too hard, and not imagining anything in particular in your mind’s eye.\n4. Is it possible I’m someone who just CANNOT meditate?\nWhen you find yourself asking that question, your meditation has officially begun. Everyone wonders that. Notice it. Escort your attention back to your object of focus (the breath). When you’re lost and questioning again, come back to the breathe again. That’s the practice. There’s no limit to the number of times you can be distracted and come back to the breath. Meditating is not a race to perfection—It’s returning again and again to the breath.\n5. Is it better to practice in a group or by myself?\nBoth are great! It’s enormously supportive to meditate with others. And, practicing on your own builds discipline.\n6. What’s the best time of day to meditate?\nWhatever works. Consider your circumstances: children, pets, work. Experiment. But watch out. If you always choose the most convenient time, it will usually be tomorrow.\n7. What if I get sexually (and physically) aroused by thoughts in my head?\nNo big deal. Meditation stokes the imagination. In time, every thought and sensation will pop up (so to speak). And come back. Same old story. Release the thought, bring awareness and receptivity to body sensations, bring attention back to your chosen object (the breath, in this case). Repeat.\n8. Do you have any tips on integrating pets into meditation practice?\nWhile meditating, we don’t have to fight off distractions like a knight slaying dragons. If your dog or cat comes into the room and barks and meows and brushes up against you or settles down on a part of your cushion, no big deal. Let it be. What works less well is to interrupt your session to relate to them. If that’s what’s going to happen, try to find a way to avoid their interrupting your practice.\n\n#### More Guided Meditation Practices\n\n### The RAIN Meditation with Tara Brach\n\nA practice for difficult emotions, RAIN is an acronym for Recognition of what is going on; Acceptance of the experience, just as it is; Interest in what is happening; and Nurture with loving presence.\n\n#### A Mindfulness Practice to Foster Forgiveness\n\nExplore this practice to let go of the tendency to add to our suffering during challenging situations.\n\n#### Additional Resources \u0026 Articles\n\nMindful has many resources to help you live a more mindful life and tap into the best of who you are:\n\n- [Getting Started](https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/)\n- [Guided Meditation](https://www.mindful.org/category/meditation/guided-meditation/)\n- [Meditation for Anxiety](https://www.mindful.org/mindfulness-meditation-anxiety/)\n- [Sign up for Mindful Newsletters](https://www.mindful.org/mindfulnewsletters/)\n- [Mindful Magazine Subscription](https://subscribe.pcspublink.com/sub/subscribe.aspx?guid=1e26c2c6-2a0b-48f0-a4e2-86cc9a400cee)\n- [Special Edition Guides](https://mindful-magazine.myshopify.com/collections/special-editions)\n- [Mindful Online Learning](https://learning.mindful.org/)\n\n## Unorganized Research\n\nThe VA has developed [a bunch of mental health apps](https://mobile.va.gov/appstore/mental-health) that are free to the general public.

Em dashes are punctuation marks used to emphasize or draw attention to parenthetical or amplifying material. They are often used in place of commas, parentheses, colons, and semicolons to increase sentence variety and readability.0 Em dashes are seen as being more interruptive or striking than other punctuation, so they are often used stylistically to draw a reader’s attention to a particular bit of information.\n\n### Examples\n\n- Mabel the Cat was delighted with the assortment of pastries the new bakery featured, but Harry the Dog—he felt otherwise.\n- While I was shopping—wandering aimlessly up and down the aisles, actually—I ran into our old neighbor.\n- An etymological dictionary is one of the few books—no, it’s the only book—you’ll ever need.\n- There has recently been an increase—though opposed fiercely by many people—in alternative education practices.\n- He was going to call off the project—or was he?—when the client increased the payment.\n- Traveling—that is, traveling by public transit—can be a relaxing activity if you bring music and reading material along with you.\n\n## En Dashes\n\nDash as wide as the letter N. An en dash is a midsize punctuation mark used to show ranges in numbers, dates, or time frames.0 It is wider than a hyphen but narrower than an em dash.1 The en dash should not be left a space between the adjacent material, and it is read as \"to\" or \"through\" depending on the context.4 It can also be used for clarity in forming complex compound adjectives.0 Most keyboards don't have a key reserved for the en dash, and it usually needs to be added as a special character on most writing programs.3 In text, don't use an en dash in a range of times. Instead, use \"to\" instead. In a schedule or listing, use an en dash with no spaces around it: 10:00 AM–2:00 PM. When replacing the words from, to, through, between, or versus, use the en dash.\n\n### Examples\n\n- Our part-time employees work 20–30 hours per week.\n- By Monday, you should have read pages 79–113.\n- The years 1861–1865 were a dark time in American history.","lastmodified":"2023-06-21T18:14:31.488164821Z","tags":[]},"/references/Skullcandy-Crusher-ANC":{"title":"Skullcandy Crusher ANC","content":"\n## Support Website\n- [Link](https://info.skullcandy.com/Support?Dest=hc%2Fen-us%2Fsearch%2Fclick%3Fdata%3DBAh7DjoHaWRsKwjGBbvTUwA6D2FjY291bnRfaWRpA3CRBzoJdHlwZUkiDGFydGljbGUGOgZFVDoIdXJsSSJXaHR0cHM6Ly9zdXBwb3J0LnNrdWxsY2FuZHkuY29tL2hjL2VuLXVzL2FydGljbGVzLzM2MDAzNDUzNDg1NC1DcnVzaGVyLUFOQy1XaXJlbGVzcwY7CFQ6DnNlYXJjaF9pZEkiKTUzNTYyNmMzLWI0MTktNGY2Yy05ZmRkLTBiNGE2NzE0NDMyYwY7CEY6CXJhbmtpBzoLbG9jYWxlSSIKZW4tdXMGOwhUOgpxdWVyeUkiEGNydXNoZXIgYW5jBjsIVDoScmVzdWx0c19jb3VudGkY--c04f82bb11ed9893aaece616370bf9e0fd29f498)\n- [User Guide - PDF](https://www.skullcandy.com/content/CrusherANC_UserGuide.pdf)\n\n## Controls\n\n### Right Earcup\n*Media controls are located on the **right** earcup.*\n\n- Play / Pause – Middle button\n- Answer Call – Middle button for 1 second\n- Hang Up – Middle button again\n- Reject Call – Middle button for 2 seconds\n- Assistant – Middle button Twice\n- Volume Up – Top button\n- Volume down – Bottom button\n- Next / Skip Forward – Top button for 3 seconds\n- Previous / Skip Backwards – Bottom button for 3 seconds\n\n### Left Earcup\n\n- Power On – Hold Power button for 3 seconds (voice prompt)\n- Power Off – Hold Power button for 4 seconds (voice prompt)\n- Subsequent Pairings – They will connect to the know device automatically.\n- Active Noise Cancellation – Power button twice (voice prompt)\n\t- ANC is *ON* automatically when powered up.\n\t- Purple LED indicates ANC is *ON*.\n\t- LED will go dark while ANC is *OFF*.\n- Ambient Mode – Touch left earcup for 3 seconds (voice prompt)\n\t- Touch again for 3 seconds to turn it *OFF*.
