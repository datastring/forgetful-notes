My name is Miguel Pimentel. I'm a tinkerer, hobby developer, and public infrastructure enthusiast. Born in the Dominican Republic and moved to Minnesota in 2015.

### Computer Programming

One of the hobbies that have stayed with me over the years is computer programming. I have been writing code since high school in the late 2000s. Never pursued a career in tech because my love for infrastructure is just _that_ big. That said, I still exercise my programming muscles regularly. The latest example of this would be the browser extensions I’ve created. They are published on the Firefox Add-ons [website](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/17772574/). These were conceived mainly for personal use, but they’ve seen some interest from others since being published.

### Web Design and Blogging

Creating this website has been fun and satisfying. It truly is the fruit of many procrastination sessions. I’ve used it, and my blog, as tools to teach myself web design. Blogging is something I’ve wanted to do regularly for years now. Never quite finding something I was happy with, until now.

### Full Time Job

I am a Construction Contract Administrator covering a wide array of civil engineering focused public works projects. I establish and administer contract procurement procedures for construction, architectural, engineering, and other professional/technical service contracts.

Some of my day-to-day duties include:

- Developing scope of services and other non-standard provisions of RFPs and consultant contracts. Participating in contract negotiations and the evaluation of proposals.
- Assisting in process management; creating, developing and initiating project controls to ensure timely implementation and successful completion of projects.
- Developing project budgets, monitoring costs, anticipating potential problem areas, identifying and implementing measures to keep the projects within budget and recommending revisions to the project budget as necessary.
- Assisting with developing project plans required to implement assigned capital and operations, often multidisciplinary projects and frequently managing several projects concurrently.
- Monitoring the work of consulting engineers for conformance with the contract requirements and professional standards.
- Assisting in the preparation of in-house designs (drawings and specifications), monitoring projects during installation/construction and commissioning phases.
- Coordinating the project with regulatory agencies, local interests, neighborhood groups, city, metropolitan, county, state, and federal governmental units, and other interested parties.
