## Activity Log

- Compiled more SVGs and PNGs for project logos. Used the first one to create a new Brave logo for my extension.
- Released version 1.1 of my Brave Search Firefox extension. Added new logo design to circumvent DMCA notices. Added 3 new keywords: `!brave`, `!b`, `@b`. [AMO Link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/brave-search-and-keyword/) / [Source](https://github.com/datastring/firefox-brave-search)
- Revamped [Projects](/docs/projects/) page with a new table layout and updated links. Included Blog, About, Journals, Digital Garden, Photo Gallery, and Firefox Addons website links.
