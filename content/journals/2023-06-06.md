Today we continue adding lots of new pages and filling in some of the category gaps.

## Activity Log

- Added external link to `Blog` atop the left sidebar.
- Modified `.gitignore` to include other Hugo directories.
- Cleaned README. Made it shorter, concise. Removed "Based on" working from repo description.
- Archived GitHub workflow. It was a duplicate entry for deploying Hugo. Should be good to delete once confirmed working correctly.
- Modified sections:
  - Inspirations
  - Tool Collection
  - Newsletter Collection
  - Podcast List
  - Added Guide section. Set as draft. I plan to publish once more guides make it to the site.
  - Cleaned and added to the Homepage.
  - Removed landing page from Learning, Lists.
  - Moved reading articles to correct section.
  - Commented out some weight yaml keys to let the sidebar sort automatically.
  - Cleaned References and Writing categories.
  - Added `Atomic Notes` post.
  - Renamed `public-journal` to `journals`.
  - Changed preferred theme to dark. Other options are light and auto.

## Sad News

Basura, our guinea pig had to be put down this morning. Be well little buddy. You were loved and enjoyed. Best guinea pig I have ever had. Sorry to see you go.
