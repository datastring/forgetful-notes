### Dowsing

> Dowsing is a type of divination employed in attempts to locate ground water, buried metals or ores, gemstones, oil, claimed radiations, gravesites, malign "earth vibrations" and many other objects and materials without the use of a scientific apparatus. It is also known as divining, doodle bugging, water finding, well witching. The motion of such dowsing devices is generally attributed to the ideomotor phenomenon, a psychological response where a subject makes motions unconsciously. Put simply, dowsing rods respond to the user's accidental or involuntary movements. Scientific evidence shows that dowsing is no more effective than random chance. It is therefore regarded as a pseudoscience. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowsing).

> An excess of the vitamin that can be contracted from eating the liver of polar bears, seals and walrus.

One officer swore never again to eat bear liver, no matter how much it might tempt him, after his crew showed symptoms akin to carbon monoxide poisoning. Native peoples have long been aware of this danger, as have explorers, though some felt no worse after eating the liver.
