## Definition

An arpeggio is **a type of [broken-chord](content/notes/Chords.md) in which the notes that compose a chord are individually sounded in a progressive rising or descending order**. Arpeggios on keyboard instruments may be called rolled chords.

Arpeggios indicate a chord in which the notes are sounded individually. The word "arpeggio" comes from the Italian word "arpeggiare," which means to play on a harp.
