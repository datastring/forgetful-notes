### ADHD Explanation From u/kaidomac

>

I definitely had a momentary inner twinge that that's not the norm for me…simply deciding to do it & not having the "Mentos & Coke" effect of mental diffusion kick in to over-think the task & then feel all of the other things I have to do start swirling around, and then feel the emotional barriers of the weight of the task & the mental energy loss from the pre-requisite requirements like having to clean up or find stuff kick in…things that aren't on anybody's normal radar at all!
>

### Shield Anvil Itkovian, Memories of Ice, Malazan Series Book 3

> We humans do not understand compassion. In each moment of our lives, we betray it. Aye, we know of its worth, yet in knowing we then attach to it a value, we guard the giving of it, believing it must be earned. Compassion is priceless in the truest sense of the word. It must be given freely. In abundance.

### XKCD Book

> Throwing is hard.
>
> 1. In order to deliver a baseball to a batter, a pitcher has to release the ball at exactly the right point in the throw. A timing error of half a millisecond in either direction is enough to cause the ball to miss the strike zone.
>
> To put that in perspective, it takes about five milliseconds for the fastest nerve impulse to travel the length of the arm. That means that when your arm is still rotating toward the correct position, the signal to release the ball is already at your wrist.
>
> In terms of timing, this is like a drummer dropping a drumstick from the tenth story and hitting a drum on the ground on the correct beat.
