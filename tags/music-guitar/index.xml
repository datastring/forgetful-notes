A chord, in music, is any harmonic set of pitches/frequencies consisting of multiple notes (also called &amp;ldquo;pitches&amp;rdquo;) that are heard as if sounding simultaneously. For many practical and theoretical purposes, arpeggios and other types of broken chords (in which the chord tones are not sounded simultaneously) may also be considered as chords in the right musical context.</description></item></channel></rss>
