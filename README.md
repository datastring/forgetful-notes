Based on [Amethyst](https://github.com/64bitpandas/amethyst), which itself is largely based on [Hugo Book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book), and [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz).

## Features

Amethyst preserves most of the features of quartz and hugo-book, including:
 - Navigation sidebars on left and right of content
 - Obsidian-style callouts 
 - Interactive graph view
 - MermaidJS charts
 - User-togglable dark mode
 - Search bar
 - Multi-language support
 - Mobile support
 - Obsidian-style back/forward links and page previews

Added functionality on top:
 - Custom formatting of tabs, sections, and expands specifically for Q&A-style interaction
 - Easy customization of theme colors and fonts
 - LaTeX enabled out of the box with no additional config
 - Support for both absolute and relative links, Obsidian-style
